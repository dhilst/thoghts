The universe is not rational in the sense that the universe is too complex in
the details for the reason to extract fundamental laws in a way that is
completely predictable. I hope this sound obvious as it is.

- Q: But doesn't the universe follow the laws of physics? We can see/test
     the underlying order of the universe!
- A: No, the laws are a simplification, a model. The models works whenever the
     abstracted details does not accumulate or the accumulation does not lead
     to divergence. As we find more predictable systems, more unprecitable
     systems pop-up. It is the same thing as with irrational numbers, we understand
     that they exist, but we can not predict all their digits, where a rational
     number. Rational "things" require 1) to be finite (of manageable size), or, 2)
     some self-similarity in their structure; to be attacked by the reason. The
     motivation for the second one is: We need some self-similarity to attack them by
     induction. The argument deals with a part of it that repeats, and, because it
     repeats, the argument applies infitely. We cannot attack a infinite,
     non-self-similar thing, with a finite argument.
