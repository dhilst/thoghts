# The Genealogy of Authority

Suppose a population. This population is composed of individuals and no
hirearchy between then. Each individual has its own personal desires and
strenght. In order to fullfill its desires each individual apply its strenght,
this give rises to conflicts when two individuals want something scarse. On
other hand each individual also desires security, so it will not get in
conflict with other individuals if this imposes a threat.

Stronger individuals will impose its will over the others, until they find one
that imposes a threat to them. At this point an hiearchy starts to form, the
first class is the winner of the conflict, the second class is the loser, and
the third class is everybody else.

The second class individuals, that cannot impose their will to the first class,
will start to impose their will to third class individuals. Third class cannot
compete in strenght with second class, so they will resort to the first class,
legitimating its power, and this is how the first class becomes an authority,
establishing an stable system with three classes, an hierarchy.

At this point the first class projects its power downwards creating a stable
zone. This stable zone will maintain the first class in power, and third class
safe and second class in its place. The second class does not legitimate the
first class authority, but cannot fight against it, and third class legitimate
the first class authority to enjoy the stability created by it.

Here we have a three classes hierarchy, generalize that for an arbitrary amount
of classes and you have a arbitrarly complex society. In complex societies the 
authority is multilayered, conflicts in the below layer are resolved by one
of the upper layers. The upper layers may act deliberaly to resolve the conflicts
or because they are invoked by the below layers. Stability is everyone's interest.

If for any reason the system becomes unstable again, the legitimity of the
authority will be in check. Because of that the second class may want to
destabilize the system on pupose, but, unstability is unpredictable and poses a
thread to the second class to so it all depends on the concrete circunstances. The
second class may want to cause an temporary unstability in order to get into the
power, but no body wants preserve unstability for to long. If the first class
falls, a competition between the second class will start again, stopping at
some point with a new first class.

So the first class is one with more strenght and legitimated by the second class,
the second class desires the first class position, but has no strength to take it.
The third class wants stability, so it legitimates the first class in order to
live in peace.

Remeber: _This is a model. All models are wrong, but some of them are useful._
